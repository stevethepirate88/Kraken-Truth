# Jingle Hell Clues

Kostadin believes there's something up with the jingle for Mepsi. Subliminal messages or something deeper. He listened to the Mepsi jingle, blacked out, and was surrounded by empty Mepsi cans.

Included in the blog post is an audio file of the jingle. You can hear the subliminal messages in the jingle, but there's something else. At the end of the jingle is a pattern of beeps that sounds a LOT like a quick dial of a phone.

I believe that is an additional clue that is worth investigating in the jingle itself.
