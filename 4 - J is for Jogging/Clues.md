# J is for Jogging Clues

Kostadin is contacted by Mr. J. He "won" an invitation to a promotional "Fun Run" via a card inside of a two liter bottle of Mepsi (purchased for research purposes, of course).

This invidation seems to encourage turning off video games (Ultra suspicious), and otherwise seems inoccuous... EXCEPT.

At the bottom of the invitation is a hidden pattern, it looks like. And below that is some very hard to read text. I believe manipulating the provided scan to further reveal both of those strange clues might be the answer here.
