# Kraken-Truth
This is here as a public repo for the Kraken ARG and solving the puzzles!


## Where We Stand

### Introduction

This all starts in the game Kraken Academy!!! when one of the characters who is a conspiracy theorist tells us to go to his website, http://kraken-net.com to learn more about how Mepsi, an Energy Drink company, is doing some shady things. Weird, right? There's no way this can-

Oh. [The website](http://kraken-net.com) is real. Haha. But if you start to dig deeper... there's actually something more nefarious going on. Reading deeper into the other website mentioned in the blog, [Mepsi Corp](https://mepsisoda.com) might actually be up to some weird stuff.

Kraken-Net has 7 blog entries so far, and each one seems to contain a different clue to get more information about Mepsi.

### The Blog Entries

1. Myserious Mr. J (Solved)
2. Jingle Hell
3. Spooky Signage (Solved)
4. J is for Jogging
5. Microchipped Cans
6. Conspiracy FM
7. Gruelling Work

All of these tie in to the larger Mepsi Conspiracy and help us with clues on how to fing more information.

### What to do

Check out the clues so far in each of the folders in this repo, and use Git Pulls and more to edit the information and share out what you've learned so far. The goal is to keep this investigation open source so we can continue to share in this interactive story together!
