# Clues on the Mepsi Corp. Website

**NOTE**: This section will likely contain spoilers for the previous clues. BEWARE.

## The Main Website

Mepsi's home page lists their various flavors:

* Energy (Now with 50% less asbestos!)
* Classic (That smooth taste, smooth texture, and - since the lawsuit - smooth can.)
* Classicer (It's a party in your moth, and someone's called the police!)
* Ham (Described by the Food Standards Agency as "technically a drink".)

Mepsi is apparently made with Mepsinite, which the site describe as "the least radioactive of the four forbidden elements." Mepsi is apparently also mildly addictive. 

## The About Page

Mepsi was founded in 1972 when it bought a farm, bulldozed it, and started mining Mepsinite. Mepsi also mines semi-precious ores and manufactures ball-bearings, industrial fitments, and military-grade washing mashines.

Its founder's name is John Mepsi. He discovered the "explosive qualities" of mepsinite accidentally which killed Dave, James, and Phyllida Mepsi. John explored the depths of Mepsinite reserves and went missing for years. When he re-emerged, he hadd "a newfound passion for mineral-based energy drinks".

On this page, some of the quotes seem to indicate that working for Mepsi is not entirely voluntary. One intern says "I don't remember applying to work at Mepsi. But I keep waking up here." Mepsi also does not apparently like blood type AB.

Mepsi also has internal coms that say "Mepsi encourages employees to take advantage of both flexitime and flexispace, working whenever and wherever we find you.".
