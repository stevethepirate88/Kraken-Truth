# Microchipped Cans Clues

Kostadin does some more digging and looks through copies of newspaper clippings at the library. He finds an old article published in 1993 in the Kraken Khronicle about Mepsi admitting to putting microchips in cans. Shock. Scandal. 

Maybe, however, there's something even more in the newspaper clipping?

I am open to all theories on this one as otherwise I don't fully know where to start.
