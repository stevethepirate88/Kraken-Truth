# Conspiracy FM Clues

Kostadin messes around with a radio a bunch and accidentally lands on a Numbers Station: A radio station that transmits the exact same signal on repeat.

Kostadinn provides us with a recording of just one such loop. Is there more to it, however? The loop starts and ends with dial dones similar to those found in [Jingle Hell](/Jingle-Hell).

Recording Transcript:


EDNO THREE ??? CHEST AWESOME ??? AWESOME SERUM THREE SERUM CHEST ?? CHEST EDNO THREE ??? CHEST AWESOME ??? AEWSOME ???? ?????? AWESOME ??? AWESOME ??????


There are several words I do not understand and cannot properly spell, but best I can make them sound like is below:

??? = Jay-tir-ee
??  = 'DVE
???? = THREE-NICE-ET
?????? = EDI-NICE-ET

I'm wondering if inspecting the dial tones will yield anything to help with figuring out some of those words. I am also unsure on "EDNO"?

Additionally might be useful to look at [Slow Scan TV](https://amsat-uk.org/beginners/iss-sstv/) To see if that gives any useful information from the audio file.
