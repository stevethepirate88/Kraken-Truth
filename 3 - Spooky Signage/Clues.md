# Spooky Signage clues

Kostadin talks to a girl who sends him photos of Mepsi signs and billboards from around town. "Tuck", "Billboard", and "Poster".

What's interesting to me is the dots on the signs for both Billboard and Truck. They fit a specific pattern of 3 rows of 26 columns. They also do not match exactly which is very strange assuming they would be coming from the same stock creative of dots, right?
