# Spooky Signage Solved

The dots seem a lot like braille. Taking the dots from just the truck or just the billobard, however, don't seem to make sense from braille. What about overlaying them?

Overlaying the dots alone doesn't work. That just reads as jibberish. How about looking at it from a "new perspective"?

Rotating either or both of them 180 degrees continues to yield jibberish that almost looks like a password? A lot of patterns that don't form any actual braille characters, though.

Overlaying then flipping horizontally doesn't give me anything either.

Overlaying then flipping VERTICALLY, however, that was the money right there. That actually reads as real letters:

Slash Style Mix. Sounds like it might be a song? Something to keep an eye out for.
